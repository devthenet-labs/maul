// Package evaluation is the wire contract between maul's evaluation
// execution service and the evolve client: the HTTP submission types, the
// in-pod event stream the runner emits on stdout, and the SSE monitor stream
// the API relays to the submitting client. It is deliberately stdlib-only
// and importable by external processes; maul interprets only the result
// and fatal events and treats everything else — including the finished
// results entry — as opaque payload.
//
// The shape of the split: maul schedules sandboxed pods, injects the model
// credential, stores bounded summaries in CR statuses and the full-fidelity
// entry in a per-unit ConfigMap. Evolve owns every evaluation semantic —
// specs, grading, the LLM judge, baselines — co-located with the workspace
// bundle inside the pod.
